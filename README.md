 In this lab I make new Reposotory and created new Empty project becous i have problem in menu.
 
 #### First We make a recyclerview In the Home page "Main Activity" to show every task as a list.

#### If you click in any Task it will take you for detail page "task detail activity" that you can show the details of the task "Title of task, Body of task and the state of task"

#### And you can see all task in another recyclerview in another page all task page "listtask activity"

# Lab 31

I created 4 test:
###  testSetting() 
To test the important UI elements are displayed on the Settings page

### assertTextChanged()
To test if you edit the userâ€™s username, and then assert that it says the correct thing on the homepage

### testOpenTaskDetail() 
To test when you tap on a task, and then assert that the resulting activity displays the title, body and state of that task in task detail page.

### testAddTask() 
To test if you can add a new task then when you tap on this task, and assert that the resulting activity displays the title, body and state of that task in task detail page.
