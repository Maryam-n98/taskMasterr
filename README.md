# Lab28

 In this lab I make new Reposotory and created new Empty project becous i have problem in menu.
 
 #### First We make a recyclerview In the Home page "Main Activity" to show every task as a list.

#### If you click in any Task it will take you for detail page "task detail activity" that you can show the details of the task "Title of task, Body of task and the state of task"
