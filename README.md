# taskMasterr
I created 4 test:
###  testSetting() 
To test the important UI elements are displayed on the Settings page

### assertTextChanged()
To test if you edit the userâ€™s username, and then assert that it says the correct thing on the homepage

### testOpenTaskDetail() 
To test when you tap on a task, and then assert that the resulting activity displays the title, body and state of that task in task detail page.

### testAddTask() 
To test if you can add a new task then when you tap on this task, and assert that the resulting activity displays the title, body and state of that task in task detail page.
